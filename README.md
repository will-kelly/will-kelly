# 👋 Hi, I’m **Will Kelly**

I turn complex technology into narratives that move markets and unblock teams.  
From container-driven DevOps pipelines to AI-powered editorial workflows, I’ve spent my career building content engines that **ship faster, sell smarter, and scale without drama**.

---

## 🧭 What I’m focused on next
| Theme | Why it matters | How I’m pushing it forward |
|-------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Content Ops as product** | Treating content like any other mission-critical system gives GTM teams velocity and insight. | Building modular frameworks, governance models, and KPI dashboards in Notion. |
| **AI-accelerated storytelling** | Large language models free writers to think instead of thrash. | Prototyping custom GPTs that cut research time by 40% and surface data-driven angles. |
| **FinOps meets narrative** | Cloud spend only changes when the C-suite cares. Stories turn cost data into decisions. |
| **Developer experience (DX)** | Devs ignore marketing fluff—until it unblocks them. | Shipping example-driven docs and containerized demos that run in <60 seconds. |

## 🛠️ Core strengths
- **Content Strategy & GTM Enablement** – Map stories to buyer pain and pipeline stages, not vanity metrics.  
- **Editorial Workflow Automation** – From CI/CD for Markdown to AI linting, I keep content shippable.  
- **Notion at Scale** – Architected multi-team wikis, content calendars, and KPI hubs that survive real usage.  
- **Product Marketing** – Translate features into differentiated positioning and field-ready collateral.  
- **Thought Leadership** – 300+ bylines in *CIO.com*, *TechTarget*, *InfoWorld*, and more.

I’m open to **full-time or fractional** roles where content is a growth lever:
- **Content Strategy / Ops Leadership**
- **Product Marketing for DevOps, AI, or Cloud SaaS**

If you need someone who can **diagnose your content bottlenecks, architect a fix, and ship it**, let’s talk.
